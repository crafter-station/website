**Setting the Stage:**

10 days.

Global stage.

Biggest players in the game.

No second chances.

We knew what it meant:

**Ship something absurdly good or get lost in the noise.**

## Day 1: The Spark

We sat down and asked:

*"What's something that feels broken today?"*

Answer: writing assistants.

- Too slow.
- Too dumb.
- Too generic.

Idea hit fast:

**What if autocomplete actually understood you?**

Not generic AI gibberish.

*You*. Your voice. Your flow.

## Day 2: First Blood

Prototyped immediately.

- Tiptap + React = fast editable surface.
- Hardcoded fake suggestions.
- Forget infrastructure. Focus on *feeling*.

## Day 3–4: Skeleton Crew

Started wiring the real brain:

- OpenAI API, fine-tuned for *whispered* completions.
- Latency budget: **< 50ms** target. No compromise.
- Custom hooks for ghost suggestions.

Text0 was ugly.

But it *felt* alive.

And that was enough.

## Day 5–6: We Hit Walls

Problem:

LLMs are slow if you send them the whole damn essay.

Solution:

- Smart windowing: send only *local context*.
- Prediction cache: pre-load probable next words.

## Day 7: Shaping the UX

No bloat.

No toolbars.

Just you, the words, and a whisper of what *could* come next.

Dark theme only.

Auto-adapting suggestion tones.

Mouse? Optional.

Keyboard? King.

## Day 8: Infra Panic

- Vercel edge functions to the rescue.
- Optimized token usage to stay *fast and cheap*.

If the first keystroke lagged, we considered it a bug.

Period.

## Day 9: Polish and Fear

- Landing page: built overnight.
- Demo: no fancy edits. Raw recording. One take.
- Presentation: tell a *story*, not just show a *tool*.

At this point?

We knew it wasn't just a hack.

**It was a product.**

## Day 10: Launch Day

Deployed.

Slept 2 hours.

Woke up to:

> "You're finalists."
> 
> "You won."

## How We Won

- **Speed:** Judges *felt* it. Zero latency.
- **Focus:** Solved a real pain. No feature bloat.
- **Polish:** It *looked* inevitable, even if it barely survived behind the scenes.

## Final Thought

We didn't just build an app.

We built a weapon for writers.

And we did it **under fire.**

> You're not typing anymore.
> 
> You're thinking faster than ever.

> That's Text0.
