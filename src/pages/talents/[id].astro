        fullTranscript: `María discusses her journey from working in traditional finance to founding her own fintech platform. She explains how witnessing the lack of accessible financial tools for everyday Peruvians inspired her to build a solution that combines education with practical financial management.

Throughout the conversation, María shares insights on building trust with users, the technical challenges of creating a secure financial platform, and the importance of regulatory compliance in fintech. She also talks about her vision for expanding financial inclusion across Latin America.

"Financial empowerment is about more than just tools—it's about education, trust, and creating systems that truly serve people's needs."`,

fullTranscript: `
We first met **Bregy Malpartida** at [Code Brew](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cuevaio_casual-code-brew-chatting-open-source-ts-activity-7373043014400647168-4jr9),
a casual community event we hosted in Lima to bring together developers, designers, and builders who love to create digital stuff.

Among everyone there, Bregy instantly stood out. He was that kind of person who could talk about math, art, and code in the same sentence — and somehow make it make sense.
We knew we had to know more, so we invited him for a proper interview.

He started programming when he was twelve, long before he realized it could become a career.
He grew up surrounded by cardboard, glue, and old machines that his grandfather kept in storage.

> I used to take things apart just to see how they worked.
> That mix of curiosity and creation never left him. It just evolved from paper mechanisms to digital ones.

Today, Bregy’s work relies between technology, mathematics, and philosophy.
He co-founded **Minski**, a tech collective built on the belief that knowledge should be open and shared.
> If you write a book, you want people to read it. Code should work the same way.

From there, he went on to explore **AI, generative art, and complex systems**, creating visuals that look less like computer outputs and more like living organisms.
His pieces explore how machines might someday *feel* alive, not just execute logic, but express it.

Earlier this year, his work appeared at the **MALI Museum in Lima**,
where he exhibited live plotter-generated prints, algorithmic drawings that evolve in real time, blending math, motion, and emotion.
Watching the machine draw felt almost meditative, like a quiet collaboration between human intent and machine precision.

Talking to Bregy feels really inspiring.
He moves easily between equations, thoughts on consciousness, and stories from his graffiti days, when he tagged Barranco’s streets with fractal triangles.

What makes him stand out isn’t just his technical skill; it’s his way of seeing.
